XTide 2.15 (2016-01-25)

   The 2.15 revision of XTide makes xttpd work with IPv6 and [3]systemd
   (neither one is a hard requirement) and catches up with the API changes
   in Xaw3dXft ver. 1.6.2d.  See [4]Changelog for what else was done and
   get it from [5]http://www.flaterco.com/xtide/files.html#xtide.

harmonics-dwf-20151227

   Data refresh available from
   [6]http://www.flaterco.com/xtide/files.html#harmonicsfiles.

libtcd 2.2.7 (2015-08-08)

   Fix an out-of-bounds access.

Harmgen 3.1.1 (2015-06-04)

   This release fixes code rot due to changes in Octave.

XTide code rot: Xaw3dXft ver. 1.6.2d (2015-01-19)

   Xaw3dXft ver. 1.6.2d made breaking changes to the API.  XTide 2.15 will
   work with 1.6.2d but no earlier version.  XTide 2.14 works with several
   earlier versions but fails to build with 1.6.2d.  [7]This patch can be
   applied to make it work.

Android and iOS ports

   [8]These ones are GPL.

New icons

   Another set of [9]improved icons for XTide has been contributed by
   Kelly Bellis.

tideEditor 1.4.3

   tideEditor has finally been migrated from Qt 3 to Qt 4.  Available from
   [10]http://www.flaterco.com/xtide/files.html#extras.

   2012-10:  A person using Debian 6 had problems building tideEditor
   because the relative paths that Qt headers used to include one another
   had changed.  It was necessary to add -I/usr/include/qt4 to the list of
   qt4 directories in CPPFLAGS (see the README) to make it build.
   However, as of Slackware 14.0 and Qt 4.8.2, the example in the README
   still works for me.  Is this a Debian nonconformity?

End of maintenance for non-free data

   For [11]various reasons, I have ended maintenance of the non-free data
   set.  Anyone interested in generating new harmonic constants from
   published data can find information and a list of data sources
   [12]here.

Mailing list

   There is an announce-only mailing list to which I send notices of each
   update to XTide or the harmonics data.  You can subscribe or read the
   archives at
   [13]http://ten.pairlist.net/mailman/listinfo/xtide-announce.

   Please note:  If an announcement to you gets bounced by your mail
   server, you fall off the list.  Some long-time contributors have fallen
   off because, unbeknownst to them, their ISPs subscribed to a spam
   blackholing service that blackholed all pair.com-hosted domains after
   one of them sent out spam.

To do list

   Congen

   Nit:  Fix parallel make race condition where congen link fails because
   libcongen didn't exist yet.

   Other:

   Without context, somebody sent a NOAA-looking YEARDATA.DAT file and a
   decoding thereof which indicated that the phases of 3KM5, RP1, and KJ2
   were reversed relative to the output of Congen.

   The notes in congen_input.txt rev. 2004/08/16 assert that RP1 and PSI1
   differ by a 180 degree shift and that KJ2 and ETA2 are nearly
   indistinguishable.  The SP 98 glossary says that RP1 and PSI1 are the
   same (p. 313).  Congen formulates 3KM5 as a compound constituent, which
   leaves no place to just flip the sign.

   A review of historical data indicates that these three minor
   constituents have never gotten much amplitude at any station.  The only
   impacted station in 2014 harmonics-dwf is Anchorage, with an amplitude
   of 0.036 ft for 3KM5.  The maximum possible difference is a measly 1.2
   inches, but reversing the phase of 3KM5 does appear to reduce the
   numerical differences with NOAA predictions from
   [14]http://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/.

   To do:  Check archives for alternate formulations of the constituents
   and compare results.  Check Congen code to see if there is room for a
   fault in the phase calculation.  Close the loop with someone at NOAA.
   Note the issue in congen input files.

   XTide

   The XML parser should be bundled under the libxtide namespace but
   isn't.

   Major things to do in XTide 3 if life turns out not to be too short
   after all:
     * Renovate programming practices again (exceptions, checked and const
       operations, strings).
     * On exceptions:  get the application-specific error messages OUT of
       libxtide.
     * Move from Latin-1 to UTF-8 (requires libtcd revision).
     * Harmonize the globe location chooser with the way that Google Earth
       operates.  Use OpenGL of course.
     * Find a way to put an end to the infinite number of customization
       settings for graph mode, such as by dumping ALL of the data,
       metadata, and events to a single-file format that an external
       graphing app will read.
     * Migrate to the windowing system that replaces X.

   The following graph mode wish list was submitted by Kirby Vandivort in
   2016-01.
     * Print the prediction value below the time.
     * Print the times of sunrise/sunset.
     * Suppress the location line.
     * Repeat the scale on the right side.
     * Subdued color/linestyle (c.f. gnuplot) when using tenths.

   harmgen
     * Use liboctave instead of a script file or convert to R.

   libtcd

   Remember to update the version strings in the pre-generated DOS/tcd.h
   and VS/tcd.h files.

   Remember to update the DOS and VS build instructions in the
   documentation and in VS/README.txt.

   Things to do in the next major revision, if there ever is one:
     * UTF-8.
     * Add header field to flag tides versus currents.
     * Add depth field for currents.
     * Get rid of internal state; fix inability to have more than one
       database open.
     * Remove gratuitous complexity in the encoding of speeds, equilibrium
       arguments, and node factors; make speeds 32-bit unsigned with no
       offset.
     * Possibly permit node factors to be specified for intervals shorter
       than 1 year and/or support apps that use libcongen to generate the
       node factors themselves.
